# Chapter5 Persisting Data

1. [ ] Run a container with a bind mount to share data with host.
2. [ ] Verify that changes in host directory reflect inside container.
3. [ ] Create a named Podman volume and mount it to a container.
4. [ ] Check details of the created volume using `podman volume inspect`.
5. [ ] Run a database container (e.g., PostgreSQL) with a persistent volume.
6. [ ] Stop and restart the DB container to ensure data persists.
7. [ ] Backup data from a volume by copying it to host.
8. [ ] Remove unused volumes with `podman volume prune`.
9. [ ] Document scenarios where volumes are better than bind mounts.
10. [ ] Summarize best practices for persisting data in containers.
